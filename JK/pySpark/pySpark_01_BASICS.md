## Introduction to Big Data with PySpark

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### What is Big Data?

**Large Amounts of Data**  
Data too big for regular computers.

**Big Data Processing**  
Tools to handle huge datasets.

**Why PySpark?**  
Makes big data accessible with Python.

### Basic Concepts

**Spark**  
Engine for big data processing.

**RDDs**  
Resilient Distributed Datasets.

**Clusters**  
Groups of computers working together.

### Simple Operations

**Creating RDDs**  
From lists or files.

**Transformations**  
Like map and filter.

**Actions**  
Like collect and count.

### Analogy  
PySpark is like a team of workers sorting through a huge warehouse of boxes (data).

### Next Steps  
Install PySpark and run a simple word count.
