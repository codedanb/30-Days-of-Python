## The Essentials of Database Querying

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### Database Fundamentals

**What is a Database?**  
A place to store and organize information, like a digital filing cabinet.

**Why SQL?**  
SQL is the language to talk to databases, retrieve and manage data.

**Tables and Rows**  
Tables are like spreadsheets, rows are individual records.

### Basic Queries

**SELECT**  
Getting data from tables.

**FROM**  
Specifying which table.

**WHERE**  
Filtering data.

### Simple Operations

**INSERT**  
Adding new data.

**UPDATE**  
Changing existing data.

**DELETE**  
Removing data.

### Data Types

**Numbers, Text, Dates**  
Different kinds of information.

### Analogy  
SQL is like asking questions to a smart librarian who knows everything in the books.

### Next Steps  
Create a simple table and query it for specific information.
