# Agile_02_INTERMEDIATE

## The Practitioner of Agile

*Target Audience*: Junior Developer / Daily User.  
*Philosophy*: Focus on "Getting things done". Standard patterns and libraries.

### Standard Library usage

Common Agile frameworks and tools:  
- **Scrum**: Roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team), ceremonies (Daily Standup, Sprint Planning).  
- **Kanban**: Visual boards with columns (To Do, In Progress, Done); WIP limits.  
- **XP (Extreme Programming)**: Pair programming, test-driven development.  
- Tools: Jira, Trello for tracking; Git for version control.

### Common Data Structures

Organizing Agile work:  
- **Backlogs**: Prioritized lists of user stories.  
- **Boards**: Kanban boards with swimlanes.  
- **Burndown Charts**: Track progress over sprints.

### Modular programming (Functions, basic OOP)

Breaking down projects:  
- **User Stories**: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]".  
- **Epics**: Large stories broken into smaller tasks.  
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed iterations.

### Error Handling (Try/Except)

Dealing with issues:  
- **Impediments**: Blockers identified in standups.  
- **Retrospectives**: Reflect on failures and successes.  
- Handling scope creep: Re-prioritize backlog.

### File I/O

Documentation:  
- Writing user stories to files.  
- Logging sprint outcomes.  
- Reading project charters.

### Getting Things Done: Running a Sprint

1. Plan sprint with team.  
2. Daily standups.  
3. Deliver increment.  
4. Retrospective and plan next sprint.

Focus on practical application in teams for efficient project delivery.
