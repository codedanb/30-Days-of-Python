# Python_01_BASICS

## The Foundations of Python Programming

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### Installation & Setup

**What is Python?**  
Python is a programming language - a way to give instructions to computers, like writing a recipe for a robot chef.

**Why Python?**  
It's beginner-friendly with simple words instead of complex symbols, used for building websites (like Instagram), analyzing data (like Netflix recommendations), automating tasks (like renaming photos), and creating games.

**How to install Python?**  
Go to python.org, download the installer for your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux), run it and follow the steps. This installs Python like installing a new app.

**Running Python**  
Open IDLE (comes with Python) or type 'python' in command line/terminal. Write code like sentences, press enter to see results. Save files with .py extension.

### Fundamental Syntax & Keywords

**What is a program?**  
A sequence of commands that tell the computer what to do, step by step, like a list of chores.

**Variables**  
Named storage boxes for data. Use = to put things in: age = 10 (stores number 10 in 'age' box); name = "Alice" (stores text in 'name').

**Basic Data Types**  
- Integers (int): Whole numbers for counting: 42, -5, 0.  
- Strings (str): Text in quotes: "hello", 'world'.  
- Floats (float): Decimal numbers: 3.14, 2.5.  
- Booleans (bool): True or False values for yes/no questions.

**Basic Operations**  
- Arithmetic: 2 + 3 (addition), 5 - 2 (subtraction), 4 * 3 (multiplication), 10 / 2 (division), 10 // 3 (integer division), 10 % 3 (remainder).  
- String operations: "hello" + " world" (combines to "hello world"), "hi" * 3 (repeats to "hihi hi").  
- Printing output: print("Hello, World!") displays text on screen; print(2 + 3) shows 5.

### Simple Logic

**Conditionals (If/Else)**  
Decision making: if age > 18: print("You can vote") else: print("Too young"). Like choosing different paths based on conditions.

**Loops**  
Repetition: for i in range(5): print(i) prints 0,1,2,3,4. Like counting to 5. While loops: while hungry: eat() continues until condition is false.

### Analogy  
Python is like LEGO blocks - you connect simple pieces (commands) to build complex things (programs). No need for glue, just snap them together.

### Next Steps  
Write a program that asks for your name (name = input("What's your name? ")) and says hello (print("Hello, " + name)). Practice math: calculate area of rectangle (length * width).
