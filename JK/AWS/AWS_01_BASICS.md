## The Alphabet of AWS

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### Installation & Setup

**What is AWS?**  
AWS is like a giant toolbox in the cloud (internet) where you can rent computers, storage, and tools to build and run applications without buying physical hardware.

**Why AWS?**  
It saves money and time. Instead of buying servers, you pay only for what you use, like renting a bike instead of buying one.

**How to start?**  
Create a free account on aws.amazon.com. Use the console (web interface) to explore.

**Fundamental Concepts**  
- **Cloud**: Computers on the internet.  
- **Services**: Tools like storage (S3), computing (EC2).  
- **Regions**: Locations worldwide.

**Basic Data Types**  
- Files, data.

**Simple Logic**  
- Upload/download.

**Analogy**  
AWS is like a public library: borrow books (resources) when needed, return when done.
