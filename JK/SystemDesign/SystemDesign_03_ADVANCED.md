# SystemDesign_03_ADVANCED

## Advanced System Design Principles

*Target Audience*: Experienced developer (Mid-level engineer).  
*Philosophy*: Dive deep into distributed systems, consistency, and performance optimization.

### Distributed Systems

**Consistency Models**  
Strong vs eventual consistency.

**Consensus Algorithms**  
Paxos, Raft for agreement.

### Performance

**Latency and Throughput**  
Measuring system performance.

**Bottlenecks**  
Identifying and resolving slowdowns.

### Fault Tolerance

**Redundancy**  
Backup systems.

**Circuit Breakers**  
Preventing cascade failures.

### Security

**Authentication and Authorization**  
User verification and permissions.

**Encryption**  
Protecting data in transit and at rest.

### Monitoring and Observability

**Logging and Metrics**  
Tracking system health.

**Tracing**  
Following requests through systems.

### Next Steps  
Design a distributed chat application with real-time messaging and offline support.
