## The Alphabet of Algorithms

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### Installation & Setup

**What is an Algorithm?**  
An algorithm is like a recipe for solving a problem. It's a step-by-step set of instructions that a computer (or person) follows to get from a starting point to a solution.

**Why do we need Algorithms?**  
Algorithms help us solve problems efficiently. Without them, tasks like finding the shortest path or sorting items would be chaotic. They make computers smart and help us in daily life, like navigating with GPS.

**How to get started with Algorithms?**  
Start with paper and pencil. Draw diagrams for simple problems. Later, use free online tools or apps to visualize algorithms.

**Fundamental Syntax & Keywords**  
Key ideas:  
- **Input**: What you start with.  
- **Output**: The result.  
- **Steps**: Instructions to follow.  
- **Efficiency**: How fast or easy it is.

**Basic Data Types**  
Simple types:  
- **Numbers**: For counting or measuring.  
- **Lists**: Groups of items.

**Simple Logic**  
Basic rules:  
- **If/Else**: Choose based on conditions.  
- **Loops**: Repeat steps.

**Analogy-heavy explanations**  
Algorithms are like following directions to bake a cake. You have ingredients (input), follow steps (algorithm), and get a cake (output). If steps are clear, anyone can do it. Another analogy: Algorithms are like a treasure map – they guide you from start to treasure without getting lost.

### Next Steps  
Learn basic algorithms like sorting toys or finding lost items. Intermediate will introduce coding them!
