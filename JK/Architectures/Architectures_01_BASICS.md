# Architectures_01_BASICS

## The Alphabet of Architectures

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### Installation & Setup

**What is Architecture?**  
Software architecture is like the blueprint for building a house. It shows how different parts of a program fit together to work as a whole.

**Why do we need Architectures?**  
Without a plan, building software is like piling bricks randomly – it might fall apart. Good architecture makes software reliable, easy to change, and scalable.

**How to get started?**  
Draw simple diagrams on paper. Use boxes for parts and arrows for connections.

**Fundamental Concepts**  
- **Components**: Building blocks.  
- **Layers**: Levels like user interface and data.  
- **Connections**: How parts communicate.

**Basic Data Types**  
- Diagrams, boxes, lines.

**Simple Logic**  
- Flow from input to output.

**Analogy**  
Architecture is like designing a toy factory: machines for making parts, assembly lines, storage.
