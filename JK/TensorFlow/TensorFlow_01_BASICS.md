## Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### What is TensorFlow?

**Machine Learning**  
Teaching computers to learn from data.

**TensorFlow**  
A tool to build and train ML models.

**Why TensorFlow?**  
Makes ML accessible and powerful.

### Basic Concepts

**Tensors**  
Multi-dimensional arrays of data.

**Graphs**  
Representations of computations.

**Sessions**  
Running the computations.

### Simple Operations

**Constants and Variables**  
Basic data in TensorFlow.

**Operations**  
Math on tensors.

**Placeholders**  
Inputs to the graph.

### Analogy  
TensorFlow is like a recipe book for teaching computers to cook (learn) from ingredients (data).

### Next Steps  
Install TensorFlow and run a simple "Hello, TensorFlow!" program.
