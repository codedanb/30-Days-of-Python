# 1. Before Programming

## What is Programming?

Imagine you have a robot. This robot can do anything you tell it to, but only if you give it very clear and specific instructions. Programming is the art of writing those instructions so the robot knows exactly what to do. In the real world, the "robot" is a computer, and the instructions are written in a language the computer understands, called a programming language.

### Real-World Analogy
Think of programming like writing a recipe for cooking. A recipe tells you:
1. What ingredients you need (data).
2. What steps to follow (instructions).

If the recipe is clear, anyone can follow it and get the same result. Similarly, if a program is well-written, a computer can execute it and produce the desired outcome.

## How Computers Execute Instructions

A computer is like a very fast but very literal chef. It doesn’t think for itself; it just follows instructions step by step. Here’s how it works:

1. **Input:** The computer receives some data (like ingredients).
2. **Processing:** It follows the instructions (like cooking steps).
3. **Output:** It produces a result (like a finished dish).

### The CPU: The Brain of the Computer
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of the computer that executes instructions. It can only do one thing at a time, but it does it incredibly fast—millions or even billions of instructions per second.

## What Does "Waiting" Mean in Computing?

Now, let’s introduce the concept of "waiting." Imagine you’re cooking pasta. You boil water, add the pasta, and then wait for 10 minutes while it cooks. During those 10 minutes, you’re not actively doing anything with the pasta—you’re just waiting.

In computing, "waiting" happens when the computer is idle because it’s waiting for something to happen. For example:
- Waiting for a file to download.
- Waiting for a response from a website.
- Waiting for a user to press a button.

### Why Waiting is a Problem
When a computer is waiting, it’s not doing anything else. This is fine if you’re only running one program, but what if you want to:
- Download a file while watching a video?
- Respond to user clicks while loading data in the background?

If the computer can only do one thing at a time, waiting becomes a bottleneck.

## Summary
- **Programming** is giving clear instructions to a computer.
- Computers execute instructions step by step, very quickly.
- **Waiting** happens when the computer is idle, and it can become a problem when multiple tasks need to run.

### Mental Model Takeaway
Think of a computer as a very fast but literal chef. It can only follow one recipe at a time, and if it’s waiting for something (like water to boil), it can’t do anything else.

### Intuition You Should Now Have
You should now understand that programming is about writing instructions for a computer, and that "waiting" is a key challenge we’ll need to solve as we dive deeper into async programming.
