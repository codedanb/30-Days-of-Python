# UnitTesting_01_BASICS

## Introduction to Testing Code

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### What is Testing?

**Bugs in Code**  
Mistakes that make programs not work correctly.

**Testing**  
Checking if code works as expected.

**Why Test?**  
To find and fix bugs early.

### Basic Concepts

**Inputs and Outputs**  
What goes in and what comes out.

**Expected Results**  
What the code should do.

**Assertions**  
Statements that check if results are correct.

### Simple Tests

**Manual Testing**  
Running code and checking manually.

**Automated Testing**  
Code that tests other code.

**Print Statements**  
Basic way to see what's happening.

### Analogy  
Testing is like checking homework before submitting to catch mistakes.

### Next Steps  
Write a simple program and test it manually.
