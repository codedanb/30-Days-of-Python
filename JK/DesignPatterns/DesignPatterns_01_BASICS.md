## The Alphabet of DesignPatterns

*Target Audience*: Absolute beginner (Grade school student / Non-technical person).  
*Philosophy*: Assume NO prior knowledge. Explain "what" and "why" before "how".

### Installation & Setup

**What are Design Patterns?**  
Design patterns are like recipes for solving common problems in building software, reusable solutions.

They make code better, easier to understand and maintain.

**How to start?**

**Fundamental Concepts**  
- **Pattern**: Solution template.  
- **Problem**: What it solves.

**Basic Data Types**  
- Classes, objects.

**Simple Logic**  
- Create objects.

**Analogy**
