# UnitTesting_03_ADVANCED

## Advanced Testing Techniques

*Target Audience*: Experienced developer (Mid-level engineer).  
*Philosophy*: Dive deep into mocking, fixtures, and test automation.

### Mocking

**What is Mocking?**  
Replacing real objects with fake ones for testing.

**unittest.mock**  
Python's mocking library.

**Patching**  
Temporarily changing code behavior.

### Fixtures

**Setup and Teardown**  
Preparing and cleaning up test environments.

**pytest Fixtures**  
Reusable test setup.

### Test Coverage

**What is Coverage?**  
Measuring how much code is tested.

**Tools**  
coverage.py for Python.

**Interpreting Reports**  
Finding untested code.

### Integration Testing

**Unit vs Integration**  
Testing components together.

**Test Doubles**  
Stubs, mocks, fakes.

### Test Automation

**CI/CD Integration**  
Running tests automatically.

**GitHub Actions**  
Example CI pipeline.

### Debugging Tests

**Failing Tests**  
Understanding why tests fail.

**Debugging Tools**  
pdb, pytest debugging.

### Next Steps  
Add mocking to existing tests and measure coverage.
