# TensorFlow_03_ADVANCED

## Advanced TensorFlow Techniques

*Target Audience*: Experienced developer (Mid-level engineer).  
*Philosophy*: Dive deep into custom models, performance, and deployment.

### Custom Models

**Subclassing API**  
Building complex architectures.

**Custom Layers and Losses**  
Tailored components.

### Performance Optimization

**Graph Mode vs Eager Mode**  
Execution modes.

**Distributed Training**  
Training on multiple devices.

### Advanced Architectures

**CNNs and RNNs**  
Convolutional and Recurrent networks.

**Transformers**  
Attention mechanisms.

### Deployment

**TensorFlow Serving**  
Serving models in production.

**TensorFlow Lite**  
Mobile and edge deployment.

### Monitoring and Debugging

**TensorBoard**  
Visualization and monitoring.

**Profiling**  
Performance analysis.

### Next Steps  
Implement a custom transformer model or deploy a model to a web service.
