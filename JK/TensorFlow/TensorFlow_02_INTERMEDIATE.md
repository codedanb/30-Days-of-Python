# TensorFlow_02_INTERMEDIATE

## Building Neural Networks

*Target Audience*: Beginner with basic programming knowledge (High school student / Early career).  
*Philosophy*: Build on fundamentals, introduce neural networks, training, and basic models.

### Neural Networks

**Neurons and Layers**  
Building blocks of neural networks.

**Activation Functions**  
Introducing non-linearity.

### Training Models

**Loss Functions**  
Measuring model performance.

**Optimizers**  
Improving the model (Gradient Descent).

**Batches and Epochs**  
Training data handling.

### Keras API

**Sequential Models**  
Easy model building.

**Layers**  
Dense, Conv2D, etc.

### Data Handling

**Datasets**  
Loading and preprocessing data.

**Feature Engineering**  
Preparing data for models.

### Next Steps  
Train a simple image classifier or predict house prices.
